# Example Flows

Minimal, repeatable flows using the CLI tools.

## Quick scan
1. `search` with `--type fast` and a small `-n`.
2. `contents` on the most relevant URL.

## Deep research
1. `research-start` with a precise instruction.
2. Poll `research-check` until `completed`.

## Code retrieval
1. `code-context` with a focused query (defaults to max tokens).
