# Nix Development

Research-first Nix development using **parallel DeepWiki queries** for accurate, up-to-date information.

## Workflow

```
1. IDENTIFY  → Match question to relevant repos
2. QUERY     → Launch parallel subagents to query DeepWiki
3. SYNTHESIZE → Combine results into actionable guidance
```

## Notes

Repo routing tables, query patterns, and DeepWiki repo lists live in `reference.md`.
